      <h1>Hi! I'm Charissa.</h1>
      <p>
        I’m a self-taught Front End Developer. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
        React JS. I am driven with a passion for learning and personal
        development. Working as a nurse with 14+ years experience taught me to
        work well under pressure, be a team player, have strong communication
        and leadership skills, accountability, and flexibility. It also allowed
        me to utilize other skills — empathy, organization skills, time
        management, adaptability and sense of humor.
